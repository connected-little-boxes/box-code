The libraries for each component in this this project are stored directly in this folder. 

This is to allow dependencies between the components to work correctly.  

There are .c and .h files for each component. A component defines either a sensor or a process. 

The end of each .c file contains the definition of a sensor or process structure value which is used in the device.

Each component contains functions which are called when the device is running. They should all complete quickly  
as the entire device is single threaded. 

The system contains lists of active sensors and processors. A given sensor or process can be removed from a 
device by not adding it into the list. 

Each component contains a structure defining the setting values for that component and management items 
for each of the settings. These are used by the settings manager in the settings.c source file to create a 
block of setting data which is stored in EEPROM inside the device.
